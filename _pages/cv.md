Education
======
* Ph.D in Fundamental Mathematics, Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics, 2026 (expected)
* Exchange Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2020
* B.S. in Mathematics, Taishan College, Shandong University, 2021 


Research Interests & Experience
=====
My research focuses on machine learning methods for multi-scale modeling, especially in quantum many-body physics and ultrafast dynamics.
* Developed machine learning potentials to simulate dynamic mechanical response of materials under extreme conditions.
* Proposed a neural network framework for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in real space.
* Familiar with deep learning techniques such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and generative models. 
* Familiar with quantum chemistry simulation methods, including traditional methods like Hartree-Fock (HF), Full Configuration Interaction (FCI), and machine learning based methods like FermiNet. 
* Current research: machine learning modeling of ultrafast dynamics in quantum many-body systems.
* Broader interests: Monte Carlo methods, scientific computing, uncertainty quantification.
