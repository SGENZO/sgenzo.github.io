I'm a PhD student at from [Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics](http://www.iapcm.ac.cn).

My current research interests include machine learning methods for multi-scale modeling, especially in quantum many-body physics and ultrafast dynamics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Han Wang](http://www.wanghan-iapcm.com) of National Key Laboratory of Computational Physics, IAPCM.

You can find my CV here: [Enze Hou's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
